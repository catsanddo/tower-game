Intro:
You dream of falling. 
Brilliant lights flash before your eyes, and you see a golden spire that rises beyond the clouds. You feel yourself stop, and the cool air rests on your skin. You awaken standing in the middle of an indigo forest.


  Bug Man: 
1 Another one, hm? Or maybe it was you who was poking around those caves. Listen, I don’t want any part of your strange antics, so I think you should just go.
-Hey! I have enough to worry about, alright?

2 Didn’t I tell you to… hey! Is that a pala fruit? Um, maybe I was too harsh earlier; you wouldn’t mind sharing that with me, would you?
-I’ll just take one bite!

3 Hm? You gave it to that red freak?! You don’t intend to go up that tower, do you?
-Don’t say I didn’t warn ya, kid. 


4 Ruins down to the south? I don’t really know what you’re talking about. 
-Hmm.


5 Wait, I think I remember it now. The people were always talking about the source of all of this. Something about a fallen star… what’s that shiny thing you got with you there? So it was in the cave this whole time?
-Hey kid, you’re really something, you know?

  Dream Worm: 
1 The tower divides and connects. Do you hear it calling you?
-I wonder…

2 A Pala fruit is a symbol of life and energy. Does the creator dictate the fate of the creation? Everything that is born is destined to die.
-Can we really trust the fate of many to the thoughts of one?

3 The entrance to the tower now lies open. You may ascend, and yet we remain.
-In our solitude, can we remember our own past?

4 There is a beginning to everything, even us. Creation started with the star. If you’ve seen the ruins, then you must understand. 
-Think carefully about what you want to do.


5 So the star still exists. You are the only one who can decide where it goes.
-But who can claim ownership of this creation?



  Ghost Girl: 
1 Aaaaah! You scared me… 
-You shouldn’t sneak up on people…


2 Oh! Someone used to bring me pala fruit everyday. It’s been so long that I can’t even remember his face.
-You’ll come and visit me again, right?


3 Do you know where everyone went? 
-Well, nevermind…


4 It’s you again! I remember your face! 
-Today I’ve been thinking about all of my favorite types of flowers.


5 It’s really good to see you! Today I remembered a song that I used to sing. Maybe I can sing it for you… but you can’t watch me! 
-Hey, there is something I want to tell you…


  
Mook: 
1 Well, this is a surprise! Not many people come to visit old Mook at his pond; not since all those folks left topwards, haha!
-Nope, nothing quite like the feeling of warm clay!


2 I’m going to bring some mudpies to my little friend.
-You don’t have to take off your shoes when you come to my house.


3 The tower? No, I can’t say I know much about that. Ever since they built it, they’ve just been sitting around! 
-Talk about a lazy afternoon!


4 I’ve been to the ruins, but there is nothing quite like sitting on your own front porch. 
-Don’t forget this; everything's better when you’re with a friend.

5 Oh, me? I’m not one of those golems, hehe. I just like it here; this pond is nice and warm.
-Will you be going back where you came from?

  Skuller: 
1 So you’re the one who has been bumping around in the woods down south. You’re causing quite a stir, you know. This cave behind me? No way, kid. I don’t move for anyone.
-Okay… fine. You get me some sweet pala fruit, and maybe I’ll move for you.


2 Haha, I didn’t think you’d actually go and do it! Yeah, this should give me enough strength to move aside for you. But don’t say I didn’t warn you; no one ever comes back from that tower.
-I hope you know what you’re doing


3 Have you spoken with the Dream Worm yet? He is the only one who really remembers anything.
-I’d visit him myself if I could move this old body of mine.


4 Ruins, you said? Hmmm, I remember hearing about those once or twice, yes. That won’t do us much good here, though.
-This town is dying.


5 Is that… the star? But wait, are you taking it with you? 
-Don’t be in a hurry, kid…


  Sword Guy: 
1 A new face? Make sure you don’t cause any trouble here, because I’m watching you!
-I’ve been guarding this town for as long as I’ve lived!


2 Oh, this sword? Yeah, I bet you’d like to hold it, huh? It’s definitely too heavy for you, but it isn’t even a problem for me.
-Heh, I can tell you’re impressed.


3 So you’re leaving, then? You’re probably eager to follow those other folk, I guess. 
-Maybe I’d join you… but I can’t leave my post.


4 I bet you’ve seen some pretty cool stuff around here, right? Maybe you can tell me about it sometime?
-I’ve never actually left the town.


5 Hey, do you think you could take me with you sometime? We shouldn’t go too far from the town, but maybe just outside the gate?
-Well, I’m not going anywhere in this state. I haven’t moved in years.
