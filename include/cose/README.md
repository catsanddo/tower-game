# COSE Library
## A unity build standard lib for C
My own personal stdlib for C inspired by [HandMade principles](https://handmade.network/manifesto).

## Features
- Memory arenas
- Some useful math functions
- Trig functions using [turns instead of radians](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/turns-are-better-than-radians) (COMING SOON)
- A proper `String` type and supporting functions (COMING SOON)
- A simple coroutine library (incomplete)
- Useful macros for generic linked lists
- Simple vector math (COMING SOON)

## Notes
- Currently not modular but may be one day

## Using
You can easily use the library as a whole simply by putting the source somewhere in your project and including `cose.h`.
Alternatively you could build the whole thing as a library with `build_lib.sh` and use the resulting static library and header file.
